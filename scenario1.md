# Scenario 1

*The following is a scenario involving a hypothetical AI-based medical device. Any resemblence to a real AI product is coincidental and unintentional.*

## Description

An AI system is used in a hospital to analyse cancer biopsy images and support pathologists in deciding which cases require urgent attention.

The system has helped the hospital screen more patients, and the pathologists have come to rely on it in their daily work.

One day, a power failure causes the system to lose that day’s data. The hospital IT team restores the system, and the pathologists re-enter the missing patient data.

After doing so, they notice something unexpected ... *the AI’s outputs are not the same as earlier that day.*

Some patients who were previously flagged as high priority are no longer flagged, while others are.

When the pathologists contact the manufacturer, they are told that the system is continually learning. Because the patient data was re-entered in a different order, the system updated itself differently, leading to slightly different predictions.

The pathologists were not aware that the system continued learning after deployment.

The manufacturer explains that without continual learning, the system could not improve over time and would remain static.

## Discussion Questions

### Immediate Reaction (Before the workshop)

- Is it a good thing that the AI system continually improves while in use?

- How would you feel as a patient knowing your diagnosis might depend on the order in which data was entered that day?

### Safety & Trust (During the workshop)

- If the same patient data can lead to different outcomes on the same day, would you consider this system safe?

- Should medical AI systems be predictable, even if that limits improvement?

- Is a "slight change" acceptable to you as a patient?

### Regulation & Governance (During the workshop)

- Should regulators require approval every time a medical AI changes?

- How should safety be assessed for systems that are never exactly the same twice?

- Who should decide when improvement outweighs unpredictability?

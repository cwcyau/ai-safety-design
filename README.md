# AI: Safety by design

## Background

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is software that is capable of performing one or more tasks using processes based on context and information available to it at the time. There are many AI products which have been developed (or are being developed) for medical purposes. AI could be used to analyse medical images, make treatment recommendations and help doctors to create, organise and arrange their entire patient management plan.

AI could be potentially highly beneficial for modern healthcare but we currenly have insufficient experience of how AI works in practice to be certain in our judgements.

## Purpose

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce participants to two illustrative examples where medical AI could be used. Participants will gain understanding of the:

- the way in which AI is different to conventional software
- the issues that AI 

## Before the workshop

Before the workshop, please read the description of both scenarios and consider the *immediate* questions posed after. You may also consider the other questions which will be discussed during the workshop:

[Scenario 1](scenario1.md) - in this example, we examine a situation in which an AI learns to improve and the consequences for those the AI affects

[Scenario 2](scenario2.md) - in this example, we examine how software upgrades can lead to challenges in assessing the usefulness of the upgrade

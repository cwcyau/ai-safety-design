# AI: Safety by design

## Background

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is software that is capable of performing one or more tasks using processes based on context and information available to it at the time. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce participants to two illustrative examples where medical AI could be used. Participants will gain some understanding of the way in which AI is different to conventional software. 

## Scenarios

The following are two scenarios 

[Scenario 1](scenario1.md) - in this example, we examine a situation in which an AI learns to improve and the consequences for those the AI affects

[Scenario 2](scenario2.md) - in this example, we examine how software upgrades can lead to challenges in assessing the usefulness of the upgrade

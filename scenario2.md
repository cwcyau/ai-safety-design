# Scenario 2

*The following is a scenario involving a hypothetical AI-based medical device. Any resemblence to a real AI product is coincidental and unintentional.*

## Description

The manufacturer of an AI system used to analyse cancer biopsy images informs a hospital that a software upgrade is available. The manufacturer says the new version is “better overall” than the current system.

The hospital decides to trial the upgrade before deploying it. The pathologists test the new software using images from 1,000 patients who were previously examined and for whom the correct diagnoses are already known.

The results show that the upgraded system is more accurate overall than the existing one.

However, the pathologists notice some discrepancies.

In particular, patients from a specific racial background are more likely to receive a different diagnosis under the new version compared to the old one.

This racial group represents less than 2% of patients seen by the hospital.

The hospital must now decide whether to keep the upgrade.

## Discussion Questions

### Immediate Reaction (Before the workshop)

Does the fact that the upgrade improves accuracy overall mean it should be kept?

Should improvements for the majority outweigh potential harm to a small minority?

Would your answer change if the affected group were larger or smaller?

## Safety & Acceptability (During the workshop)

Does it concern you that a software upgrade can change medical diagnoses?

Should upgrades in healthcare be treated differently from upgrades in other software (e.g. phones or cars)?

Is it acceptable for diagnoses to change if the system is “more accurate”?

## Fairness & Ethics (During the workshop)

Does the small size of the affected group matter ethically?

Who should decide whether this level of disparity is acceptable?

Should patients be informed if an AI system performs differently for certain groups?
